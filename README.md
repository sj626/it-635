designing a relational database that can be used to solve a business problem (keeping track of inventory, hours, employees, funds, etc.). also 
creating the SQL code needed to build the database. It has a minimum of three tables, each with its own primary key.
eachtables have foreign key constraints for accessing other tables and uses sequences where useful.
